# üèóÔ∏è How to add a demo to the playground

This `how-to` guide will help you create a demo and add it to the WebAPIS Playground repository with a few simple steps.

## 1. Prerequisites

Our team recommends using `Typescript` but feel free to write the Web APIs demo in `Javascript`.

We assume you have `forked` the repository and `cloned` it locally. As prerequisites, please make sure you have installed all dependencies using,

```shell
npm install # Or yarn install
```

Also, you can launch the playground locally using,

```shell
npm run dev # Or yarn dev
```

By default, the playground is running on port 3000.

## 2. Add and Assign an issue

Next, please check if [there is an existing issue/feature request](https://github.com/atapas/webapis-playground/issues) available for your demo. Also, make sure it is not owned by anyone else. Please assign the issue to yourself.

If you do not find an existing issue, please [create a new one](https://github.com/atapas/webapis-playground/issues/new/choose) and assign it to yourself.

## 3. Create a branch

Please create a branch for the issue. The branch name should be `demo-<issue-number>-<some-text-about-it>`. For example, if the issue number is `14`, the branch name should be `demo-14-geo-location`. Now switch to the branch and start working on the demo.

## 4. Add a demo

Please open a command-line tool and run the following command from the root of the project,

```shell
npm run gen-demo # Or yarn gen-demo
```

Now you will be asked to give answers to a few questions.

1. Give us a demo id:
   This is the id of the demo that you want to add. Please provide a unique id, for example, `payment-request`(assuming you are adding a demo for the Payment Request API).

2. Please provide a demo title:
   This is the title of the demo that you want to add.

3. Tell us more about the demo:
   This is the description of the demo that you want to add.

4. Give us the feature URL from https://caniuse.com/:
   This is the feature URL of the demo that you want to add. Please provide a feature URL, preferably in this format, `https://caniuse.com/payment-request`(assuming you are adding a demo for the Payment Request API)?

5. Tell us your name:
   This is the name of the author of the demo you want to add.

6. Your Twitter username:
   This is the Twitter handle of the author of the demo that you want to add.

7. Your github username:
   This is the Github handle of the author of the demo that you want to add.

## 5. Autogenerating the code for the demo

1. The code will be generated in the `modules` folder:
   Here you find two other folders `apis` where you write the `api` logic and `demos` where you write the `UI` to show the `api` working.

2. The `hasSupport()` method:
   It is important to define the browser support for an API in the `hasSupport()` method of your API file. Please check the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) for the support logic for the API you are adding.

## 6. Update the main Readme file

Please update [this section of the page](https://github.com/atapas/webapis-playground#-whats-included) with your new demo inclusion.

## 7. Complete Demo Coding and Create Pull Request(PR)

Once done, please create a Pull Request following the Pull Request template. Once you create a PR, you will get a deployable demo link created for you, and you will be able to see the demo in the playground. Please verify it before you mark the PR work as done.
